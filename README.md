# Corsair-to-Lwjgl-key-mapper

# What does it do?
It remaps the Corsair sdk LedIds to the lwjgl key codes.

# Why did I make it?
I needed it and I thought I should release it, so no one else has to do it.

Please put any improvement suggestions into the Issue tracker. The same goes for suggesting to add a new key!
