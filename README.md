# Corsair-to-Lwjgl-key-mapper

### What does it do?
It remaps the Corsair sdk LedIds to the lwjgl key codes.

### Why did I make it?
I needed it and I thought I should release it, so no one else has to do it.

You will need this library for it to work: https://github.com/FiercestT/corsair-cue-java

Please put any improvement suggestions into the Issue tracker. The same goes for suggesting to add a new key!
